# CLAUDE.md — Codex Listical

## Project overview

Listical is a 12-week cycle-planning tool for creative practitioners, structured around a three-page flow: **Goal** (define and plan projects), **Plan** (schedule weekly time blocks per project), and **System** (track individual tasks across an 84-day timeline). A "year" is a 12-week cycle. The three pages are exposed under the nav labels Goal / Plan / System but their URL paths are `/staging`, `/tactics`, and `/` respectively — keep this mismatch in mind. All three pages are now through their second pass of refinement. The project is in pre-launch mode, working through the risk-ranked bug list in `CODE_REVIEW_April2026.md` before a public launch targeted at UK and European conservatoire students.

## Architecture decisions — do not contradict these

### Storage modules — always use them, never bypass them

All planning data currently lives in localStorage. Three named storage modules own this:

- `stagingStorage` — Goal page data (`src/lib/stagingStorage.js`)
- `tacticsMetricsStorage` — Plan page metrics (`src/lib/tacticsMetricsStorage.js`)
- `plannerStorage` — System page task rows (`src/utils/planner/storage.js`)

**Never add raw `localStorage.getItem` / `setItem` / `removeItem` calls to page or component code.** Always go through the storage modules. The storage service (`storageService`) automatically prefixes keys with `user:{userId}:` when a user is authenticated — bypassing it breaks per-user data isolation.

### Cross-page communication — custom events only

Pages communicate via custom browser events:

- `staging-state-update` — fired by `stagingStorage.saveStagingState`; listened to by TacticsPage and `useProjectsData` (System)
- `tactics-metrics-state-update` — fired by `tacticsMetricsStorage.saveTacticsMetrics`; **no current consumers** (the previous `useTacticsMetrics` hook was deleted as orphaned dead code in 2026-05; System reads only the sent-metrics snapshot, not the live one). The event still fires so the storage module's API stays uniform with the others.
- `tactics-chips-state-update` — fired by `tacticsStorage.saveTacticsChipsState`; listened to by `useTacticsChips` (System)
- `tactics-settings-state-update` — fired by `tacticsStorage.saveTacticsYearSettings`; **no current consumers**. Settings are read by Plan, System (`incrementMinutes` only), and Plan-internal hooks, all of which read on mount or on chip events rather than subscribing. The event is fired for parity with the other year-scoped storage modules and to make a future cross-page consumer cheap to wire in.
- `tactics-send-to-system` — fired by TacticsPage `handleSendToSystem`; listened to by `ProjectTimePlannerV2`
- `yearMetadataStorage` — fired by `yearMetadataStorage.saveYearMetadata`; listened to by `YearContext`

**Do not add direct imports between page components** (Goal, Plan, System) to share data. The event system is the contract.

**Year-scoping on events (H3 fix, 2026-04-24):** Every year-scoped event above (`staging-state-update`, `tactics-metrics-state-update`, `tactics-chips-state-update`, `tactics-settings-state-update`, `tactics-send-to-system`) carries a reserved `__eventYear` field on its `CustomEvent.detail` so listeners can ignore cross-year cross-talk. Dispatchers spread `__eventYear: yearNumber` alongside the payload; listeners short-circuit if `event.detail.__eventYear` is set and does not match their own `currentYear`. `useStorageSync` takes an optional `currentYearNumber` prop for this. `yearMetadataStorage` is intentionally not tagged — it's inherently global. **When adding any new cross-page custom event, include `__eventYear` in the detail if it carries year-scoped data.**

### Storage key scoping

All storage keys are scoped by year number, e.g. `staging-year-1-shortlist`, `planner-year-1-project-1-task-rows`. When a user is authenticated, the storageService further prefixes all keys with `user:{userId}:`. Follow the pattern `{domain}-year-{N}-{descriptor}` for any new keys.

**All eight tactics page settings are year-scoped (May 2026 split).** `startHour`, `startMinute`, `incrementMinutes`, `showAmPm`, `use24Hour`, `startDay`, `chipDisplayModes`, and `summaryRowOrder` live under `tactics-year-{N}-settings` via `loadTacticsYearSettings(yearNumber)` / `saveTacticsYearSettings(payload, yearNumber)`. Both throw if `yearNumber` is missing. The legacy global `tactics-page-settings` key is no longer read or written; a one-shot module-load cleanup in `tacticsStorage.js` wipes it from any user's localStorage. Do not reintroduce a global tactics settings blob.

### `projectNickname` as join key — known fragility, do not extend

`projectNickname` is the current join key between the Plan and System pages. Weekly quota lookups in System are performed via `projectWeeklyQuotas.get(projectNickname)`. This is fragile: if a nickname is changed on the Goal page, quota lookups in System silently return zero. **Do not add any new logic that depends on `projectNickname` as a join key.** When the Supabase migration happens, `id` will replace `nickname` as the join key everywhere.

## Draft year / Plan Next Year flow

A draft year (`status: 'draft'`) can exist alongside the active year. Only one draft year may exist at a time.

### Year statuses

- `active` — the current working year; fully writable
- `draft` — the next year, in planning mode; all three pages are writable but it is not the "live" year
- `archived` — a completed year; read-only

### Plan Next Year flow

1. User presses **Plan Next Year** in the gear menu → `createDraftYearFromActive` (`src/utils/planner/createDraftYear.js`) is called
2. Year N+1 is created with `status: 'draft'`; Year N data is copied into Year N+1 (Goal page, Plan chips/metrics, UI settings). Year N's task rows are **not** copied — the user imports them separately.
3. The UI switches to the draft year. A violet nav group appears to the right of the main nav for quick access to the draft year's pages.
4. The user works through Goal → Plan → System on the draft year freely. Changes save immediately (same autosave as other years).
5. On the draft year's System page, an **Import tasks from Year N** panel appears when task rows are empty. The user selects which statuses to import (default: all except Done/Abandoned) and presses Import — one time only.
6. When ready, user presses **Archive Year N?** in the gear menu → `ArchiveYearModal` + `performYearArchive` archives Year N and promotes the draft to `active`. Two guards apply: (a) **empty-shortlist guard** — if a draft year exists, `validateYearReadyForArchive` and `performYearArchive` both reject the operation when the draft's Goal page has no projects (M3 fix, 2026-05). The modal renders this in the existing red Cannot Archive panel and disables the Archive button. (b) **metadata rollback on failure** — `performYearArchive` snapshots `app-year-metadata` before the first mutation and restores it in the catch block, so a mid-flight failure leaves Year N active and the user can retry (M2 fix, 2026-05). The result object includes a `rolledBack: true|false` field on the failure path.

### Chip persistence

Tactics chips are persisted per year to `tactics-year-{N}-chips-state` via `saveTacticsChipsState` / `loadTacticsChipsState` in `src/lib/tacticsStorage.js`. Chips are loaded on mount via `useState` initialiser — they are not deferred. The previously planned `scheduled_blocks` Supabase table is no longer needed.

### Dev-only: Undo Draft

An **Undo Draft** button in the nav bar (all three pages) calls `undoDraftYear` (`src/utils/planner/undoDraftYear.js`), which deletes all draft year storage keys, removes the draft year record from metadata, and switches back to the active year. Remove this button before launch. Tracked as B4 in the code review; intentionally deferred until the final pre-launch polish pass because Prentice still needs it for manual testing of the Plan Next Year flow.

## Planned migration — work in progress

### Supabase migration (scheduled after Tactics second pass)

The goal is to move all planning data — goals, tactics metrics, chips state, task rows — into Supabase tables, replacing localStorage. **The storage module API will stay the same; only the internals change.** Consumers of `stagingStorage`, `tacticsMetricsStorage`, and `plannerStorage` should not need to change.

**Current state:** A planning schema was authored in `supabase/migrations/20260102000001_initial_schema.sql` (tables: `years`, `projects`, `subprojects`, `planner_rows`, `day_entries`, `tactics_daily_bounds`, `project_weekly_quotas`, `tactics_chips`, `user_preferences`). The client has **zero references** to any of these tables today. All three pages have been rewritten since that migration was written, so the schema is drifted. Known blockers that must be fixed by a new migration *before* client porting begins:

1. `years.status` CHECK allows only `'active'` and `'archived'` — missing `'draft'`, which the current app uses as a first-class status.
2. `tactics_chips` is missing columns (`day_name`, `duration_minutes`, `start_minutes`, `user_modified`, `chip_time_overrides`) and its `column_index CHECK (0–6)` excludes project-column chips.
3. No sent-snapshot layer — the two-layer live/committed model needs either a boolean flag + partial unique index, or parallel `*_sent` tables.
4. `project_weekly_quotas.project_label` should be `project_id UUID FK` to fix H1 at the schema level.
5. `ON DELETE CASCADE` coverage from `auth.users(id)` through the full planning table tree must be audited before launch (GDPR).

Full delta lists per storage module live in the audit addendum of the code review doc.

## Known issues — do not make worse

- **`handleArchiveWeek` is inline in `ProjectTimePlannerV2.jsx`.** A previous `useArchiveOperations.js` hook duplicated this and was deleted in 2026-05 after confirming it was never imported. Do not reintroduce a hook version unless you are also planning to rip the inline implementation out at the same time.
- **`useComputedDataV2.ts` has an intentional write-back loop.** It reads `data`, computes derived fields, then writes them back via `setData`. This is intentional and converges. Do not remove the write-back without fully understanding the convergence behaviour.
- **`projectColumnTotals` in TacticsPage is computed but never serialised.** Do not attempt to use it in System until the Supabase migration creates a proper read path.
- **`tactics-column-widths-{year}` is written directly with `storage.setJSON`** inside a `useEffect` in TacticsPage, bypassing the storage module pattern. Do not replicate this.

## Dead code — do not import or build on these

The following files are orphaned or superseded. Do not import them, reference them, or build new code on top of them:

| File | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/hooks/planner/useComputedData.ts` | Superseded by `useComputedDataV2.ts` |
| `src/components/SupabaseTest.jsx` | Debug component; not rendered anywhere |
| `src/hooks/planner/useCellSelection.js` | Not imported by any current page |
| `src/hooks/planner/usePlannerRowRendering.js` | Not imported by any current page |
| `src/hooks/planner/usePlannerInteractions.js` | Not imported by any current page |
| `src/hooks/planner/useRowDragSelection.jsx` | Not imported anywhere |
| `src/utils/plannerStorage.js` | Legacy; active storage is `src/utils/planner/storage.js` |
| `src/utils/rowDataTransformers.js` | Likely legacy utility |
| `src/utils/plannerStyles.js` | Likely legacy utility |
| `src/utils/plannerFormatters.js` | Likely legacy utility |
| `src/timeline/useTimelineRows.js` | Leftover from earlier architecture |
| `src/constants/plannerConstants.js` | Only referenced by legacy `plannerStorage.js` |

## Conventions

- **Storage modules** live in `src/lib/` (staging, tactics) and `src/utils/planner/` (system). Follow existing patterns when extending storage.
- **Hooks** are split by page under `src/hooks/staging/` and `src/hooks/planner/`. New hooks go in the relevant folder.
- **Year-scoped keys** follow the pattern `{domain}-year-{N}-{descriptor}`.
- **Do not add `console.log` calls to production code.** There are already stray ones (e.g. `TacticsPage.jsx` line ~813) — do not add more.
- Page names in the nav (Goal / Plan / System) do not match their URL paths (`/staging`, `/tactics`, `/`). Always use the nav names when talking about features; use paths only when discussing routing.

## User context and compliance requirements

Listical will be used by students at dance conservatoires and universities, potentially including minors. **GDPR compliance is a hard requirement.**

### Right to Erasure

When a user requests deletion, all their data must be removable. The `deletion_audit_log` table and `deletion_requested_at` field on `profiles` are the start of this. The Supabase migration must extend Right to Erasure to all planning data tables.

### Database design rules (applies to all future Supabase tables)

- **Every new table must include a `user_id` foreign key** referencing `auth.users(id)` so data can be located and deleted per user.
- Do not store any data that cannot be attributed to a specific user and deleted on request.
- Row-level security (RLS) policies must be defined on every new table before it is used in production.

### Age and consent

First clients are UK and European. The operative framework is GDPR-K, whose default age of digital consent is 16. Listical enforces a minimum age of 16 across the stack:

- **Database (source of truth).** `public.profiles.date_of_birth` is `NOT NULL` and a `CHECK` constraint plus a `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE` trigger (`validate_age_requirement`) reject any row where the DOB is NULL or indicates under 16. Applied in `supabase/migrations/20260425000001_bump_age_requirement_to_16.sql`.
- **Client (UX).** `src/pages/SignupPage.jsx` caps the year dropdown at `currentYear - 16`, computes age from the picker, and shows a "must be 16 or older" message. This layer is convenience only; the DB is the real gate.
- **Signup flow.** Supabase email confirmation is enabled, so `signUp` does not return a session. `AuthContext.signupCore` surfaces `{ user, session, error }` and `SignupPage` renders a "Check your inbox" card when `session` is null. `signup` is intentionally **not** wrapped with `useAsyncHandler` (same reason as `sendOtp` / `verifyOtp`): flipping AuthContext's global `isLoading` causes `PublicRoute` to render its spinner, which unmounts SignupPage mid-flow and wipes local state. Do not re-wrap it.

Do not make further assumptions about user age elsewhere in the app. Do not collect data beyond what is necessary for the planning features.

### Email and auth infrastructure (launch prerequisite)

Supabase's built-in SMTP is development-only and rate-limited to roughly 2 auth emails per hour per project. It will block real users during any normal signup rush. Before public launch, configure a custom SMTP provider (Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, or similar) under Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings in the Supabase dashboard. Until then, expect intermittent 429 "email rate limit exceeded" errors during multi-account testing.

### Debugging
Always ask for permission to start systematic debugging.
